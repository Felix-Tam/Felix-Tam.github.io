        <h3>RESEARCH QUESTIONS:</h3>
        <h4> What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? </h4> 
        
       <p>Initially, when I entered the site I was instantly encapsulated in the waveform like ripple effects that were created following the movement of my mouse. This initial reaction put the effect at the forefront of my experience, with the secondary elements including the title and various settings being less dominant in the composition.</p> 
       <h4>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Hover the mouse over title ‘ Fractal Fantasy ’, the text became darker </li>
        <li>clicking around the screen with the mouse</li>
        <li>Pulling the screen with the mouse click</li>
        <li>Dragging the various sliders and options      </li>
        <li>Altering the effects with the various sliders and settings</li>
        <li>Continue clicking around the screen to try and figure out what is going on </li>
        <li>Using the ‘reset’ action to clear the screen to its original state  </li>
        <li>Toggling the ‘refraction/reverb’ option with mouse click </li>
        <li>Toggling the volume of the site using the volume icon in the bottom right </li>
        <li>Took screenshots of the patterns for later use in my website</li>
        <li>Closed the website and end the interaction</li>
      </ol> 
      <h4>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h4>
      <p> As the majority of the screen space is dedicated to the interactive element itself, this was definitely the area in which I spent the most time engaged with. The extensive options and settings available to change the effects of the patterns and swirls hook you in and make you as the user want to explore what kind of cool combinations can be made. </p>
      <h4> What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h4>
      <p>As you try clicking around you quickly realise that the reactions are influenced only by the movement of your mouse. I found shifting the mouse around the page to be the most common interaction, as it continuously engaged me with hypnotic patterns and waveform ripples dancing around the screen. </p> 
      <h4>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h4>
      <p>I believe the intention of the website experience is to provide a multi sensorial experience that stimulates the viewer's senses. 
        The idea of entropy and liquid entropy is very interesting and I find this website to be a great example of how it can be not only explored but presented, with the users being directly able to toggle certain settings to a cool visual experience from their actions.
        Overall, the primary goal of the interactive experience seems to be to provide a visually and aurally fascinating experience that is both entertaining and thought-provoking.</p>
      <h4>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?
    </h4>
    <p>The interactive experience’s effective use of combined multimedia elements around computer generated effects, sound, video and movement create a visually and aurally engaging experience for the viewer.

        The overall layout and design of the website heavily contribute to achieving its primary goal. It is minimalistic and clutter free, drawing the users attention solely to the central interactive element of the site. 
        
        Moreover, the interactive experience is highly intuitive with clear simple directions and options for the user to explore. These visual cues make it simple for the user to guide themselves around the page, which ultimately helps frame the experience for the viewer and provide some context.
        
        Overall, the interactive experience effectively communicates its primary goal of providing an immersive experience through its effective use of multimedia elements and intuitive design.
         </p>
       <h4>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? </h4>
       <p>The site presents a vast array of varying settings and toggles that allow the user to change the interactive experience. With this clearly presented on the right hand side of the screen, the user will spend plenty of time testing out how altering certain variables influences the effect. 
        These also influence the arpeggiating synthesiser harmonics reverberating as the user fidgets with their mouse up and around the screen, changing the pitch and frequency of the audio.
        I spent over 15 minutes testing out each setting one by one, then figuring out which ones create the most visually and sonically appealing result.
         </p>
    <h4>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?  </h4>
    <p>The website conveys a clear and concise primary function with the interactive element being at the forefront. The visuals and effects are designed to respond to real time user inputs, therefore providing immediate feedback and reinforcing the cause and effect relationship between the users and the interactive element itself. 
        With the variety of options and settings available for the user to try out, this allows for extensive engagement with the site as curiosity will drive the user to explore.
        However, the site is quite limited as there is no primary textual content or other sections of the website for the user to guide through. This could ultimately lead to the user losing interest once they have explored the extent of the interactive element.
         </p>
        <h4>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h4>
        <p>Possible references to other media forms that can be identified definitely root from a unification between digital video, visual art and audiovisual production.
            The use of bright flashy colours, dynamic motion and psychedelic imagery is a clear nod towards art movements, such as Psychedelia which emerged around the mid 20th century. The use of audio, specifically the synthesisers and other sound effects within the site reflects the visual aspect of randomness and kinetic movement and draws from audiovisual production.
            Although not directly being a media form, the use of fractals and repetitive geometric patterns is not towards the fields of computer graphics and mathematics.
            A still image of an empty warehouse incorporating a dull cool colour composition, presumably taken with a digital camera, is also positioned within the background.
             </p>
        <h4> What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</h4>
        <p>When taking into account the various media forms this site takes from, it is helpful to adopt a more experimental and playful mindset when exploring the site. This site prompts users to be imaginative, testing out various settings through trial and error in order to discover and create interesting visual patterns and forms. 
            The visuals are generated in real time and directly respond to users input, meaning it is helpful to be patient and observant with how the certain controls and user gestures affect the resulting patterns created. Once the user gets a feel for how the site works, it will come as second nature to be experimental, with the visual and auditory feedback reflecting the users movements and choices. The site is overall very intuitive for anyone to visit and figure out how to operate.             </p>
            <h4>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h4>
            <p>The hypnotic visual and sonic elements together evoke feelings of wonder and awe. I personally found the experience to be calming and meditative, as I enjoyed observing the slow and deliberate evolution of the visual patterns over time. 
                In reference to Psychedelia visuals and audio, the bright and colourful hypnotic patterns with synthesised slow pace sounds create a sense of tranquillity and playfulness.
                The combination of the slow rising audio sample paired with the synthesisers almost creates the feeling of an alien spaceship of some sort preparing to take off.
                 </p>
                <h4>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h4>
                <p>
                    I found some of the interactions with the use of a mouse to be quite unsatisfying. Generally, users find satisfaction in effects of their own inputs, and within this site the left mouse click does not interact with any of the visual components. I found this to be quite frustrating as I would have liked to be able to click and drag the screen to stretch and warp it, however if you are able to get past that, the functionality and aesthetics of the site are very satisfying.
                    Additionally, I'm sure many would find the site's purpose to be quite unsatisfying as there is no proper structure or goal to achieve within the interaction. 
                    
                    </p>
                    <h4>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I felt that the most satisfying element of the interaction was finding the balance between the various sliders and options in order to create a visually striking pattern or formation. The entire process of experimentation, trial and error ultimately make the final result of your creation that  much more satisfying.
This helped me stay engaged with the site for a prolonged period of time, wanting to explore how far I can push the site in creating the most aesthetically pleasing pattern. A sense of balance is achieved once you are able to leave the cursor idle and watch as your creations unfold.
